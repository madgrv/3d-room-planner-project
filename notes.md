Project Notes Creation Report
Task Overview
The task was to create a text file named 'project_notes.txt' containing structured information about a 3D room visualization project built with React Three Fiber and TypeScript. The file needed to include details about core MVP features, technologies used, implementation steps, and user requirements.

This task was successfully completed with the creation of a well-formatted text file containing all the required information.

Final Output Description
File: project_notes.txt
Location: Root directory of the project
Content: The file contains four main sections documenting:
Core MVP Features implemented in the project
Technologies used in development
Implementation steps taken
User's prompts and requirements
This document serves as a reference for the project details and will be useful for future development or when revisiting the project after some time.

Key Information Included
The project_notes.txt file documents important aspects of a 3D room visualization project:
